EZ extension with some translation tool.

For the moment :
copy_translation.php script copy objects of one language in another language.

run help_cptrans.php for viewing possibles helps.
look at owtranslationtools.ini.append.php to see possibles INI parameters.

TO DO :
- add possibility to specifie a 'section_name' (now only section_id is possible)
- copy_translation_subtree.php is in developpement (not available for the moment)

Bug to fix :
For some objects impossible to publish (objects without a parent_node_id)
for the moment I skip theses, otherwise i got a fatal error :
fetching node by node_id return null.
There are normally objects losts in DB.
